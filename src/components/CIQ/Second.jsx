      <h1>How would you describe yourself?</h1>
      <p>
        When interviewers ask you to talk about yourself, they're looking for
        information about how your qualities and characteristics align with the
        skills they believe is required to succeed in the role. If possible,
        include quantifiable results to demonstrate how you use your best
        attributes to drive success.

      <p>
        Hi there, I'm Shailesh Chaudhari. Describing myself, I'd say I'm a
        final-year student who loves working with computers. I'm into Node.js,
        Express, React, MongoDB, Javascript, C++, and Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there's more to me than just coding. I enjoy talking with people and
        being part of a team. One cool thing I did was creating a Cricket
        Auction System for my college sports club. It's like an online cricket
        auction site where teams can bid for players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from tech, I believe in making things easy for everyone to
        understand. So, that's a bit about me â€“ a tech enthusiast who loves
        teamwork and making tech simple and fun!
