      <h1>Why should we hire you?</h1>
      <p>
        While this question may seem like an intimidation tactic, interviewers
        generally bring this up to offer you another opportunity to explain why
        you’re the best candidate. Your answer should address the skills and
        experience you offer and why you’re a good culture fit.
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        You should hire me because of the unique combination of skills, passion,
        and experience I bring to the table. With five years of dedicated
        experience in application development, I've honed my abilities to
        navigate the complexities of creating robust and efficient solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets me apart is not just my technical proficiency but also my
        alignment with the company's mission and values. From my limited time in
        the office, I've sensed a positive and innovative culture that resonates
        with my professional aspirations. I am eager to contribute to a
        workplace that has the potential to reshape the industry, and I believe
        my skills and enthusiasm make me an excellent fit for this exciting
        journey.
