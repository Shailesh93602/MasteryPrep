      <p>
        This might be one of the most important questions asked during the
        interview process because it allows you to explore any subject that
        hasn’t been addressed and shows the interviewer you’re excited about the
        role. By this point, you’ll likely have already covered most of the
        basics about the position and the company so take time to ask the
        interviewer questions about their own experiences with the company and
        gain tips on how you can succeed if hired.

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely, I have a few questions that I believe will give me deeper
        insights into the role and the company. Firstly, could you share what
        you personally love about working for this company? Understanding your
        experiences can provide valuable perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I'm curious about what success looks like in this role.
        Having a clear picture of expectations will help me align my
        contributions with the company's goals. Lastly, could you shed light on
        some of the challenges people typically face in this position? This will
        allow me to better prepare for potential hurdles and contribute
        effectively to overcoming them.
