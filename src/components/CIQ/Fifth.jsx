      <h1>What are your greatest weaknesses?</h1>
      <p>
        It can feel awkward to discuss your weaknesses in an environment where
        you're expected to focus on your accomplishments. However, when answered
        correctly, sharing your weaknesses can show that you are self-aware and
        want to continuously get better at your job--traits that are extremely
        attractive to many employers. Remember to start with the weakness and
        then discuss the measures you've taken to improve. This way, you're
        finishing your answer on a positive note.

      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        One area where I've focused on personal development is my inclination to
        sometimes find it challenging to decline additional tasks. In the past,
        I would take on numerous projects, often leading to an overwhelming
        workload. Particularly earlier in my career, I found myself working
        evenings and weekends to meet all commitments, which eventually became
        stressful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing the need for a healthier balance, I took proactive measures
        to address this weakness. I adopted effective workload management tools,
        which allowed me to prioritize tasks more efficiently. Additionally, I
        started setting clearer expectations for myself and my team, ensuring a
        realistic and manageable workflow. Through these adjustments, I not only
        mitigated the stress associated with an excessive workload but also
        enhanced my overall productivity and contributed more effectively to
        team goals.
