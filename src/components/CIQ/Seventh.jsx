      <h1>Where do you see yourself in five years?</h1>
      <p>
        Understanding how you imagine your life in the future can help employers
        understand whether the trajectory of the role and company fits in with
        your personal development goals. To answer, provide general ideas about
        the skills you want to develop, the types of roles you would like to be
        in and the things you would like to have accomplished.
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        In the next five years, I envision myself becoming a recognized industry
        expert in my field, equipped with the skills to effectively train and
        mentor aspiring individuals, especially students and entry-level
        designers. My goal is not only to excel in my technical expertise but
        also to contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of others
        in the field.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I aim to deepen my knowledge in user experience (UX),
        allowing me to play a pivotal role in collaborating with design and
        marketing teams on large-scale projects. I am passionate about
        contributing to initiatives that make a significant impact, both within
        the company and on a global scale. Ultimately, I see myself as a
        well-rounded professional, actively shaping the landscape of design and
        leaving a positive mark on the community.
