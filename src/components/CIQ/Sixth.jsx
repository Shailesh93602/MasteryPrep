      <h1>What are your goals for feature?</h1>
      <p>
        Often, hiring managers ask about your future goals to determine whether
        or not youâ€™re looking to stay with the company in the long term.
        Additionally, this question is used to gauge your ambition, expectations
        for your career and your ability to plan ahead. The best way to handle
        this question is to determine your current career trajectory and how
        this role plays into helping you reach your ultimate goals.
      </p>
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        My future goals revolve around continuous growth in both my marketing
        expertise and leadership skills. Over the next several years, I aim to
        further refine my capabilities in crafting effective marketing
        strategies and campaigns. One of the reasons I am particularly drawn to
        opportunities in a fast-growing startup environment is the prospect of
        wearing various hats and collaborating across multiple departments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strongly believe that the diverse experiences gained in such an
        environment will serve as a valuable asset in achieving my ultimate goal
        of leading a marketing department. I am enthusiastic about contributing
        to the dynamic and evolving landscape of a growing company, and I see
        this role as a crucial stepping stone in realizing my long-term
        aspirations
