        This question gives you an opportunity to talk about your technical and
        soft skills. To answer, share qualities and personal attributes and then
        relate them back to the role for which you're interviewing.

      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <p>
        I consider my greatest strength to be my innate ability to navigate and
        solve complex problems. I find a deep sense of satisfaction in delving
        into challenges, dissecting them, and uncovering innovative solutions.
        It's akin to solving a puzzle for me, and this knack for problem-solving
        has been a constant thread throughout my personal and professional
        journey.

      <p>
        In the realm of product development, I see every challenge as an
        opportunity to innovate. I'm drawn to this career path precisely because
        it allows me to leverage my problem-solving skills in finding creative
        and effective solutions. Whether it's streamlining processes, enhancing
        functionalities, or addressing technical hurdles, I bring a proactive
        and analytical mindset to the table, always eager to contribute to the
        continuous improvement of projects and teams.
