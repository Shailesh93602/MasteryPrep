      <h1>Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), the cornerstone of computer
        science and programming. DSA plays a crucial role in designing efficient software solutions
        and optimizing problem-solving approaches.

        <b>What are Data Structures?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Data Structures are the building blocks for organizing and storing data in a computer.
        They provide a systematic way to manage information, making it easier to perform various
        operations, such as searching, sorting, and manipulating data efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What are Algorithms?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They act on the
        data structures, performing tasks like searching, sorting, and processing information.
        Efficient algorithms are essential for optimizing the performance of software applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Why Study DSA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding DSA is like having a powerful toolkit for tackling complex computational
        challenges. It empowers you to write efficient, scalable, and maintainable code, making
        you a more effective and versatile programmer.
